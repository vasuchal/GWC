# GWC Recollect
Even with all of todayâ€™s advancements in technology, there are still limited resources available for Alzheimers patients and caretakers.  Recollect aims to address these issues. Recollect is an accessible, senior-friendly mobile application that aims to improve the quality of life for both Alzheimers patients and caretakers by keeping patients virtually connected with their caretakers and abridging the need for 24-7 physical monitoring. Recollect helps patients in a variety of ways ranging from connecting the caretaker's account to the patient's account so daily reminders can be sent to helping them recognize family. Alzheimer's not only affects patients but also their caretakers as it has an enormous toll on their time and mental health. Recollect aims to provide convenience and ease stress upon caretakers and patients. From the patient's side of this account, the patient stays connected with friends, family, and their caretaker, preventing isolation and allowing them to stay updated. This application is an MVP intended to assist in the visualization of this product and is coded through PHP, Javascript and SQL. Start at the signup.html page!
